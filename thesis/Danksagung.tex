First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Johannes Rutzmoser for the continuous support of my study and related research, for his patience, motivation, and immense knowledge I am deeply grateful of his help in the completion of this thesis.  His guidance helped me in all the time of finite element research and get in with Finite- Element- Research- code. I could not have imagined having a better advisor and mentor for my study in Finite- Element- Method.
