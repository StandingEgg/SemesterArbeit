\section*{Abstract}
The motivation of this paper is to implement Python code in Finite Element Toolbox AMfe for achieving to an exact approximation of strain and stress. The problem we are trying to solve in this paper is expansion of Finite Element Toolbox AMfe, which makes it possible to solve strain and stress with 2D element types: Tri3, Tri6, Quad4, Quad8, and 3D element types: Tet4, Tet10. The approach we adopt to solve the problem is Stress-Recovery-Algorithms. This is a method by extrapolation from Gauss points in compare to the algorithms of direct evaluation at nodes. The results obtained in this research include the extrapolation function for stress recovery with six element types: Tri3, Tri6, Quad4, Quad8, Tet4, and Tet10. Patch test of both algorithms and a convergence analysis for all six element types are also presented in this paper. In the end of this paper, the strain and stress contour plot by both algorithms(Stress-Recovery-Algorithm and direct evaluation at nodes) will be compared to the solution calculated by the commercial Finite Element software ANSYS. The impacts of our obtained results proves that the solution of Stress-Recovery-Algorithms is closer to analytical solution than direct evaluation at nodes.
